# Horiseon: Code Refactor

## Description

In this application I refactored code in order to meet accessibility standards. I made the code more congruent and organized with semantic HTML and CSS, and comments throughout. I also added a descriptive title for the webpage, as well as `alt` attributes to images and icons for accessibility.

### Take-Aways

- My motivation for this project is to "learn by doing". I wanted to learn about refactoring, acessibility standards for webpages, and semantic formatting.

- I built this project to enhance my progrmmaing skills.

- The problem my refactored code solves for this company is that they will now be ranked higher in search engines due to meeting better accessibiltiy standards. This all goes into search enginge optimization solutions for the webpage.

- I learned about accessibilty standards,refactoring code, writing READMEs, organizing and commenting on my code, and semantical HTML and CSS.
