# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Description

In this application I refactored code in order to meet accessibility standards. I made the code more congruent and organized with semantic HTML and CSS, and comments throughout. I also added a descriptive title for the webpage, as well as `alt` attributes to images and icons for accessibility.
